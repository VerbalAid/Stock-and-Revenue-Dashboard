Stock and Revenue Data Dashboard
Overview
This project provides interactive dashboards for visualizing the historical stock prices and quarterly revenue of Tesla and GameStop. The stock price data is retrieved using the yfinance library, while the quarterly revenue data is extracted using web scraping. The visualization is done using plotly, allowing you to interactively explore the data.

The dashboard consists of two main sections:

Historical Share Price: A graph displaying Tesla's or GameStop's stock price over time.
Historical Revenue: A graph displaying the quarterly revenue of Tesla or GameStop.
This project allows users to compare the stock and revenue data for both companies side by side.

Technologies Used
yfinance: To retrieve historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
requests & BeautifulSoup: For scraping quarterly revenue data from a specific web page.
pandas: For managing and manipulating the data.
