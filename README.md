Stock and Revenue Data Dashboard
Overview
This project provides interactive dashboards for visualizing the historical stock prices and quarterly revenue of Tesla and GameStop. The stock price data is retrieved using the yfinance library, while the quarterly revenue data is extracted using web scraping. The visualization is done using plotly, allowing you to interactively explore the data.

The dashboard consists of two main sections:

Historical Share Price: A graph displaying Tesla's or GameStop's stock price over time.
Historical Revenue: A graph displaying the quarterly revenue of Tesla or GameStop.
This project allows users to compare the stock and revenue data for both companies side by side.

Technologies Used
yfinance: To retrieve historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
requests & BeautifulSoup: For scraping quarterly revenue data from a specific web page.
pandas: For managing and manipulating the data.
plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.

Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

yfinance: For retrieving stock price data.
requests & BeautifulSoup4: For scraping revenue data.
plotly: For creating interactive charts.
pandas: For data manipulation.
To install these libraries, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install yfinance requests beautifulsoup4 plotly pandas
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project and generate the dashboards for Tesla and GameStop:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Stock-and-Revenue-Dashboard
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Make sure the necessary Python libraries are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, if you don't have a requirements.txt, you can install each library individually as mentioned earlier.

Step 3: Run the Python Script
Run the stock_revenue_dashboard.py script to generate the interactive dashboards:

bash
Copy code
python stock_revenue_dashboard.py
This will retrieve stock data for Tesla and GameStop, as well as the quarterly revenue data, and display the results in your default web browser.

Step 4: Interact with the Dashboard
Once the dashboards are rendered in your browser:

You can zoom in and out of the charts to explore specific time periods.
Hover over the data points to see detailed information about stock prices and revenue.
The dashboard will show:

Historical Share Price: The stock price over time for the company.
Historical Revenue: Quarterly revenue data displayed alongside the stock price.
Step 5: Customize the Data
You can customize the following:

Date Range: Adjust the time periods to focus on a specific range by modifying the make_graph() function in the code.
Other Companies: Modify the script to add stock and revenue data for other companies by using their respective ticker symbols and adjusting the revenue scraping logic if needed.
Example Customization
If you want to change the date range for Tesla's stock and revenue data, modify the make_graph() function like this:

python
Copy code
stock_data_specific = stock_data[stock_data.Date <= '2021-12-31']
revenue_data_specific = revenue_data[revenue_data.Date <= '2021-12-31']
Replace '2021-12-31' with your desired end date.

Data Sources
Stock Data: The stock data for Tesla and GameStop is retrieved using yfinance from Yahoo Finance.
Revenue Data: The revenue data is scraped from a webpage containing quarterly revenue tables for both companies. The scraping URL is:
Tesla: Tesla Revenue Data
GameStop: Same URL, different table names for GameStop.
Troubleshooting
Missing Data: If you encounter any missing data or errors, ensure that the yfinance library is correctly installed and that the URL for the revenue data is accessible.
Web Scraping Issues: If the structure of the revenue data webpage changes, you might need to modify the scraping logic in the stock_revenue_dashboard.py script.
